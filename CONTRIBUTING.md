# Contributing Guidelines

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Sign off Your Work

The Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing to the project. Here is the full text of the [DCO](./DCO). Contributors must sign-off each commit by adding a Signed-off-by line to commit messages.

This is my commit message

```
Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
See git help commit:

-s, --signoff
    Add Signed-off-by line by the committer at the end of the commit log
    message. The meaning of a signoff depends on the project, but it typically
    certifies that committer has the rights to submit this work under the same
    license and agrees to a Developer Certificate of Origin (see
    http://developercertificate.org/ for more information).
```

# How to Contribute

  1. Fork this repository, develop and test your changes on that fork.
  2. All commits have a meaningful description, are signed off as described above and verified.

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose.
