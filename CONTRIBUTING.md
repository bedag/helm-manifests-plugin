  * [About commit signature verification](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/uthenticating-to-github/about-commit-signature-verification)

### Sign off Your Work

The Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote or therwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing to the project. Here is the full text of the DCO](./DCO). Contributors must sign-off each commit by adding a Signed-off-by line to commit messages.

This is my commit message

```
Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
See git help commit:
-s, --signoff
    Add Signed-off-by line by the committer at the end of the commit log
    message. The meaning of a signoff depends on the project, but it typically
    certifies that committer has the rights to submit this work under the same
    license and agrees to a Developer Certificate of Origin (see
    http://developercertificate.org/ for more information).
```
